As a front-end developer, it is easy to become confused and overwhelmed, causing you to look through the internet for resources to help your project. And your search, more often than not, will lead you to two main sources of information: Stack Overflow and a documentation page.

## Stack Overflow vs Documentation

Stack Overflow and other similar resources are a great source of information for all programmers. However, one important thing to note is that they are _not_ tutorial websites/forums. They do not tell you how to use a language or programming tool in complete detail. Instead, they are places where one can ask specific questions and get detailed answers pertaining to specific situations. Therefore, it is not a great place to look to when learning a broad new concept.

### Stack Overflow

### Postman Documentation

The documentation page, on the other hand, contains full detailed usage of a tool or language. By looking at the documentation first, you will get a good preliminary understanding of what a tool or language is capable of, and how to use it. Thus, once you have a good grasp of the new content, you will be able to ask more meaningful questions instead of blindly going through various SO posts to learn.

In this activity, we will be walking through an API's documentation that was created using Postman's documenter that you will use for your website. You will learn how to use the documentation to gain a fundamental understanding of the capabilities of the API, and how to properly use it.
