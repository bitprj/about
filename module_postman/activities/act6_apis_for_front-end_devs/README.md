## Activity/Lab Name

APIs for Front-End Devs

## Long Summary

Students will be using NASA's API on Postman with the goal of implementing the API's requests into their own website. They will test different HTTP requests and use the API's documentation on Postman. They will then create code to implement the request into their website.

## Short Summary

Students will practice using Postman's documentation to test API calls in Postman to implement them in their own website.

2. Where do you modify the parameters for the HTTP request in Postman?
3. Why is it important to tests HTTP requests instead of solely relying on documentation?
