Navigate to the Astronomy Picture of the Day \(APOD\) **Today** GET request in the NASA API Postman collection you opened earlier: ![](https://i.imgur.com/86M0B5x.jpg)

Prior to testing the **Today** GET request, you first need to select the **NASA Environment** as your Postman environment. Then, be sure to set your API key to the key you received from NASA's website: ![](https://i.imgur.com/YBvRt9q.jpg)

Now if you click **Send** for the request, you'll receive some JSON data as a response. In this response, you'll find a link to the Astronomy Picture of the Day that NASA is providing you. You can use this link in your website to display various images of space. As we saw from the documentation, you can change the **date** of the image and whether you want to receive an **hd** URL or not. You can try changing the **date** or **hd** option in the request URL to test the endpoint in Postman to receive different images.

It is important to **always** test out our HTTP requests first. The first reason being so that we can know the structure and the data of the request response. By knowing both, we will be able to navigate through the object and access specific parts of it. The second reason is that by testing out the request first, we will know in full detail on _how_ to use it. As explained later on, documentation is not perfect and it is only through real practice and experimentation can we fully understand the usage of the tool or language we are reading about.
