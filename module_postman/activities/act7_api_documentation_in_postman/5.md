This part is very important as the description box will tell other developers about the APIs inside our API documentation, as well as various important details that should be known about their usage. Once done, you will want to click save in order to create our API collection.

## Naming the APIs

As you may have noticed, the API names are currently the API links we gave in the URL box. To change this, simply go the side bar menu and click on three dots besides the API name. Then click rename and Name the APIs accordingly.
