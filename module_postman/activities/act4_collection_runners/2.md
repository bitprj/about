Now that we know what Collection Runner can do, let's use it to try to clear the BitBlox site.

How are we going to do this? We can loop through the entire board by looping through the IDs and execute a delete request for each ID. To do this, lets go modify our the **delete** request from before. We'll edit the url so instead of the the actual box number, we have a variable instead. As with most variables, you're free to call this variable whatever you'd like but we will be calling it **box\_id**. When using variable names in Postman, surround them with two brackets like so: .

The delete URL should now look like this

```text
https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/delete/{{box_id}}

OR 

{{url}}delete/{{box_id}}
```

Now if we open our Runner tab, something like this should show up.

Since we want to clear our board we only have to select the `DELET` request from our collection to run so lets deselect the others right now.

Now that we have a request to run, now lets set up our other settings. Lets choose the environment which is simply just Deploy. Next we choose the number or itterations for our `DELET` request. Since we have 400 blocks, we want to do 400 iterations to clear our board. However, if we wanted to delete only half the board, we could just do the first 200 blocks by using 200 iterations.

Its up to you whether or not you want to add a delay to the **Run**. For some applications, a delay is useful, but for simply clearing the board, adding a delay has no significant purpose. Make sure the save responses and save cookies after collection run boxes are checked off!

Most of our setting are now set! Before we run however, how are we going to pass the box number as a variable into Postman so our board gets cleared? We can use a supporting data file for that! We will explore this next.
