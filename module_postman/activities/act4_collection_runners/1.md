# Collection Runners in Postman

Up until this point, we've been manually sending a request to change each block's color. However, our BitBlox site has 400 blocks! Not only is manuaully sending 400 impractical it is also inefficient when we want to test our program espcially as our programs get more advanced. Luckily Postman has such a great feature called the Collection Runner that can help automate the process of sending requests. Running a collection sends the requests in the collection one after another and can help streamline testing since it can be used with data files\(`.cvs` or `.json`\) to set options like number of itterations and amount of delay between requests. For our example, the Collection Runner allows us to efficiently send requests to the entire board by looping through all the possible IDs and executing requests for each ID.

How do we run a collection with Collection Runner? You can access it by clicking on **runner** in the top left corner as depicted in the image below:

This will bring you to the Collection Runner window that will allow you to choose your settings for what you want to run. In the picture below are the settings for Collection Runner.
