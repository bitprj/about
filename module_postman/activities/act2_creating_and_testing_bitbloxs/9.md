# PUT Request

If while you are sending your POST request, you receive

```javascript
{
    "data": "You cannot send a POST request to an already colored tile. You have to use a PUT request."
}
```

Then, it is because you are sending a POST request to an already colored tile.

In this activity, we will be using PUT request to update the color of boxes.

According to documentation, the routes for the PUT request is the following: `https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/change/<int:box_id>/<string:color>`

Go ahead, and set up a PUT request in Postman.

Replace `<int:box_id>` and `<string:color>`, and send out a request to watch the color of the box changes!
