# API Authentication

We have one last step to complete setup before we can start sending out requests. We still need an API key to access the API.

Go to the `Authorization` tab and select the authorization `type` as `API Key`.

Set the key paramter as `api_key`.

For the value parameter we will be using the other environment variable that we created earlier. Enter `{{api_key}}` into the value parameter.

For `Add to` parameter, set it as `Query Params`.

If you attempt to send out a request without authenticating, you will receive an error message:

```javascript
{
    "message": "You are not authenticated, you need an API Key to use this route"
}
```

Now that our request has all the information that we need! We should be able to send any request of our choice!
