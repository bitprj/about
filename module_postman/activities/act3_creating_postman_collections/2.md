# Creating Environments

Before we start adding requests to our Color Changer collection, let's create an **environment** that will allow us to store variables. Putting variables in an environment saves us time: instead of having to retype long elements, such as an URL, we can simply use the variable name instead.

To create an environment, click the large **NEW** button on the top left corner and then click on **Environment**.

Color Changer Environment:

Now we are going to walk you through creating the new environment for our BitBloxs API. Lets name our new environment **Deploy** where it says `Environment name`. The table under that will alow us to create the variables:

In the **VARIABLE** column, add the variables **url** and **api\_key**. For the **INITAL VALUE** and **CURRENT VALUE** columns corresponding to **url**, enter our URL [https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/](https://bitbloxs.herokuapp.com/). For the **INITAL VALUE** and **CURRENT VALUE** columns corresponding to **api\_key**, let's enter a generic API key such as **thisistheapikey**. Here's what your table should look like after you fill it out:

Now you can click **Add**, and our environment will be created. Since we made the new environment, we want to make sure that it is the active environment that Postman will be using when we try to access our variables. To do so, find this part of the Postman window:

Make sure that the bar in the above image indicates that the active environment is **Deploy**. If not, click on the dropdown menu and select **Deploy**:

To use our environment variables, it requires this format: `{{variableName}}`. We'll get practice using variables when we start adding requests to our collections.
