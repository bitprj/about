This exercise will be specifically talking how to process the traditional \(non-AJAX\) web form.

Our goal is to write a route \(`'/form'`\) that processes HTML form input \(`<form><input name="str"/></form>`\) and responds with the value of `str` backwards.

To start lets name this file `forms.js` first include the `express` module in out program and create an instance:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var app = express()
```

Express.js uses **middleware** to provide extra functionality to your web server. Middleware lies between an operating system and the applications running on it and enables communication and data management for distributed applications, providing a large variety of functionality such as logging, serving static files, and error handling.

Simply put, a middleware is a function invoked by Express.js before your own request handler.

In this program we are going to use the middleware `urlencoded()` from the `body-parser` module. To do this first let's import the `body-parser` module just like we did for the `express` module, lets just put them together for the sake of visuals:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()
```

How can we access the middleware now that we imported the module? We call the `use()` function and pass the desired middleware as a parameter. Note that we do not have to process complex queries \(inputs\) so we can parse with the querystring library built into express.

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))
```

Now that we have our middleware added, the next step is to handle POST requests. POST requests are like GET requests in the way that it requests that a web server accepts data, but, instead of appending the variables to the URL string like with GET, POST sends data in the from of request message where the data is included in the body of the request.

We can make a POST request simply with the `post()` method. The general form of a post request should look something like \` app.post\(url,requestHandler,\[reqHandler2,...\]\)

Our program now looks like this:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){

         })
```

We are almost done! now we just have to send the backwardsinput string. We do this with the `send()` method where we place what we want to send back as a parameter. What do we need to do reverse the string? We can first split our input string character by character, reverse them then rejoin them together. We could do this in many ways but one way we can do it simply is through premade functions and do it in one line:

```javascript
req.body.str.split('').reverse().join('')
```

now we just return it with `send()` and our code should look something like this:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
  res.send(req.body.str.split('').reverse().join(''))
})
```

Lastly, we just have to start the Express.js serve with `listen()` where the port number\(where the server is started\) is passed as a parameter.

Our final code should look something like this:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
  res.send(req.body.str.split('').reverse().join(''))


app.listen(3000)
```

Lastly, we just have to start the Express.js serve with `listen()` where the port number\(where the server is started\) is passed as a parameter.

Our final code should look something like this:

Our final code now looks something like this :

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var bodyParser = require('body-parser')
var app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}))

app.post('/form',fucntion(req, res){
  res.send(req.body.str.split('').reverse().join(''))
})


app.listen(3000)
```

To run your code properly, lets download the `body-parser` module and the `nodemon` module so we can connect our express server to a port. Lets do that right now in terminal

```text
npm install nodemon
npm install body-parser
```

After running the program by typing

```text
nodemon forms.js
```

into the terminal, head over to the browser and type:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

to see your program in action!

Congratulations! You finished the activity!
