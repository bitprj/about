# 311

Define `BitBox` such as this:

```python
class BitBox(Box):
```

So that the program would know that it inherits from class `Box`, and would have the following methods: `add`, `empty`, `count`.

Define the `__init__` function such as this:

```python
     def __init__(self):
            self._items = []
```

So that an empty list of items are created, when we instantiate a `BitBox`.
