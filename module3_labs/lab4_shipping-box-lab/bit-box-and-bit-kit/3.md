Now write two subclasses of `Box` which use different underlying collections to store items. Consider what data structures to use to store items in `BitBox`and `BitKit` based on the requirements for each class. Hint: review the pros and cons of lists and dictionaries.

Remember that `add`, `empty`, and `count` must be implemented to override the parent's abstract methods. Recall that`add` is for adding any number of items to the box, `empty` is for taking all the items out of the box and returning them as a list, and `count` is for counting the items which are currently in the box.
