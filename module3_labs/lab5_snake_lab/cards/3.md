The snake still needs to be able to grow when it collides with an apple and die if it collides with itself or the walls.

A `Snake` class should also have methods:

* `grow` which increments the grow number
  * `grow` is only called when the snake is growing after eating an apple
  * The grow number keeps track of how many tiles the snake has grown already
  * If the grow number reaches `GROWTH_PER_APPLE`, the apple has run its course, and the snake stops growing and the grow number is reset
* `check_collisions` checks for collisions with apples, body, and walls
  * A collision with an apple indicates the apple has been eaten - what should you do in this case?
  * A collsion with the body or walls indicates death
