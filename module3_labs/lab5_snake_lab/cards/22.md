# 22

The `Apple` class has the following attributes:

* `position`  - random position that is generated by the `respawn` function
  * Think about what your `respawn` function relies on: there are two sets involved!
* `walls` 
* `color` - color of the apple found in the dictionary `COLORS`
  * How could you get a value from a dictionary?

Make a constructor to initialize the attributes.
