Start with the function declaration with the parameters `walls` and `snake`.

```python
def __init__(self, walls, snake):
```

Then initialize the attributes.

Initialize the position of the apple by calling the apple's respawn function which takes in the obstacles. In this case the obstacles are the snake's body or the walls. This is where our set operator `|` comes into play:

```python
    self.position = self.respawn(snake.body_set|walls)
```

For the walls, they are still walls.

```python
    self.walls = walls
```

Finally the color of the apple can be found from the dictionary `COLORS`.

```python
    self.color = COLORS["apple"]
```
