First create the `grow` function declaration.

```python
def grow(self):
    """Increment grow number and reset if done."""
```

Increase the `grow_number`.

```python
self.grow_number += 1
```

Check if the `grow_number` has reached `GROWTH_PER_APPLE`.

```python
if self.grow_number == GROWTH_PER_APPLE:
```

If is has, reset the `grow_number` and `growing`.

```python
self.grow_number = 0
self.growing = False
```
