## Time and Space Complexity

## Long Summary

Algorithms require an input to run. As the input grows, learn about what happens to the memory usage and space usage. Learn about how to describe this rate.

## Short Summary

Learn about the different rates at which algorithm's memory usage and runtime increase

## Criteria

-Know what Time Complexity is, and the different rates of growth a function can have.

-What is Space Complexity? If one has to choose, what is of higher priority: space or time? Why?

-Create a function with O\(n^2\) time. How is it O\(n^2\)?

## Difficulty

Easy
