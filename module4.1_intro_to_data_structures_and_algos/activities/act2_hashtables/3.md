Let us understand the need for a good hash function. Assume that you have to store strings in the hash table by using the hashing technique {“abcdef”, “bcdefa”, “cdefab” , “defabc” }.

To compute the index for storing the strings, use a hash function that states the following:

The index for a specific string will be equal to the sum of the ASCII values of the characters modulo 599.

As 599 is a prime number, it will reduce the possibility of indexing different strings \(collisions\). It is recommended that you use prime numbers in case of modulo. The ASCII values of a, b, c, d, e, and f are 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, and 102 respectively. Since all the strings contain the same characters with different permutations, the sum will 599.

The hash function will compute the same index for all the strings and the strings will be stored in the hash table in the following format. As the index of all the strings is the same, you can create a list on that index and insert all the strings in that list.

> Note: here, it will take **O\(n\)** time \(where n is the number of strings\) to access a specific string. This shows that the hash function is not a good hash function.

| ASCII Value | Letter |
| :--- | :--- |
| 97 | a |
| 98 | b |
| 99 | c |
| 100 | d |
| 101 | e |
| 102 | f |

Here, it will take **O\(n\)** time \(where n is the number of strings\) to access a specific string. This shows that the hash function is not a good hash function.

Let’s try a different hash function. The index for a specific string will be equal to sum of ASCII values of characters multiplied by their respective order in the string after which it is modulo with 2069 \(prime number\).

String Hash function Index abcdef \(97_1 + 98_2 + 99_3 + 100_4 + 101_5 + 102_6\)%2069 38 bcdefa \(98_1 + 99_2 + 100_3 + 101_4 + 102_5 + 97_6\)%2069 23 cdefab \(99_1 + 100_2 + 101_3 + 102_4 + 97_5 + 98_6\)%2069 14 defabc \(100_1 + 101_2 + 102_3 + 97_4 + 98_5 + 99_6\)%2069 11

> Calculating the value for 'abcdef'. a = 97  _1 // It is in the first position b = 98_2 // it is in the second position c = 99_3 // It is in the third position d = 100_4 // It is in the fourth position e = 101_5 // it is in the fifth position f = 102_6 // It is in the sixth position

So overall, when you're implementing the hash table depending on the size of your list, you want to create the best hash table that can hash the values in your list in the most efficient time.
