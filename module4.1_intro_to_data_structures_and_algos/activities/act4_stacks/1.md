In this section you are about to learn one of the very basic and most useful data structure concepts known as a **Stack**.

data structure **Stack** can be shown as below:

> The above image is **Stack Data Structure**. A Stack is a **Last In First Out \(LIFO\)** data structure. It supports two basic operations called **push** and **pop**. The **push** operation _adds_ an element at the **top of the stack**, and the **pop** operation _removes_ an element from the **top of the stack**.

When you hear the word Stack, the first thing that comes to your mind may be a stack of books, and we can use this analogy to explain stacks easily! Some of the commonalities include:

1. There is a book at the top of the stack \(if there is only one book in the stack, then that will be considered the topmost book\).
2. Only when you remove the topmost book can you get access to the bottom ones. No Jenga games here! \(Also assume that you can only lift one book at a time\).
3. Once you remove all the books from the top one by one, there will be none left and hence you cannot remove any more books.

> The above image is a visual representation of how a stack works.

Overall, the point of a stack is to ensure that the item that's placed highest \(in our case placed last\) has the most priority to be removed. The stack follows the concept of LIFO \(Last In, First Out\) in which the last item in our stack will be removed first.

**Things to remember :**

1. The entry and exit of elements happens only from the top of the stack 
2. Push - Adding an element to the Stack \(at the **top of the stack**\)
3. Pop - Removing an element from the Stack \(at the **top of the stack**\)
4. Random access is not allowed - you cannot add or remove an element from the middle.

Note: **Always keep track of the Top.** This tells us the status of the stack.
