Now, let's learn about new fancy HTML5 tags that will help us format and design the layout of a webpage!

### HTML `<main>` element

The `<main>` tag represents the main content of the `<body>` of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to, or expands upon the central topic of a document or the central functionality of an application.

The content of a `<main>` element should be unique to the document, excluding any content that is repeated across a set of documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos and so on.

Example:

```markup
<main>
    <h1>Important article about something</h1>

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
    <p>Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
    <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam, nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</p>
    <p>Duis aute irure dolor eu fugiat nulla pariatur.</p>
</main>
```

### HTML `<header>` element

The `<header>` tag represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, a search form, and so on.

Example:

```markup
<header>
    <h1>Main Page Title</h1>
    <img src="site-log.png" alt="Site logo">
</header>
```

### HTML `<nav>` element

The `<nav>` tag represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links. A document may have several `<nav>` elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra-page navigation.

```markup
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

### HTML `<footer>` element

The `<footer>` tag represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

```markup
<footer>
    Some copyright info or perhaps some author
    info for an <article>?
</footer>
```

### HTML `<section>` element

The `<section>` element represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Each `<section>` should be identified, typically by including a heading \(`<h1>`-`<h6>` element\) as a child of the `<section>` element.

Example:

```markup
<section>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
</section>
```

### HTML `<aside>` element

The `<aside>` element represents a section of a document with content connected tangentially to the main content of the document \(often presented as a sidebar\).

```markup
 <aside>
   <!-- aside content -->
 </aside>
```

### HTML `<article>` element

The `<article>` tag represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

Example:

```markup
<article>
    <!-- content of article goes here -->
</article>
```
