# LINKS AND REFERENCES

Links allow you to move from one web page to another. If you've been on the Internet, you most likely have experience with links already!

The link can lead not only to HTML-files, but also to a file of any type that can even be placed on another site. The main thing is to have access to the document to which the link is made.

To create a link, you need to tell the browser what is the link, and also specify the address of the document to which you want to link. Both actions are performed using the `<a>` \(**anchor**\) tag:

```markup
 <a href="https://google.com/">Google</a>
```

An **href attribute** contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink points to.

Besides href, links also have a lot of useful attributes. Here are the most important of them:

* **download** - this attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it.
* **target** - specifies where to display the linked URL. It is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context: a tab, window, etc.

Moreover, you also can put an image inside of link, so you'll get an clickable image, like this:

```markup
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">
    <img src="path/to/google-logo.png"
            alt="Google logo" />
</a>
```

In the example above, we are defining the link to Google's main page using image. We've also specified a `target="_blank`", which means this link will be opened in new browser window.

It's common to create links that open in the user's email program to allow them to send a new message. This is done with a mailto: link. Here's a simple example:

```markup
<a href="mailto:email@someone.com">Send email to someone</a>
```
