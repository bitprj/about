Unordered lists look similar to ordered ones. Describing of list items remains the same, keep using `<li>` tag. The main difference is that you need to wrap all list items in `<ul>` tag, which stands for unordered list. `<ul>` tag represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

The `<ul>` element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.

Example:

```markup
<ul>
    <li>first item</li>
    <li>second item</li>
    <li>third item</li>
</ul>
```

Preview:

* first item
* second item
* third item

Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a square.

If you need to set the bullet style for the list, take a look at type attribute. It can take these values:

* circle
* disc
* square
