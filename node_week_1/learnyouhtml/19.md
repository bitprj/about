Now you know the basic of styling and composing text in HTML!

Let's move on to the how-to of creating a web page with UI elements you used to see on real sites and web-applications. This can be achieved with blocks.

## HTML `<div>` element

Let's familiarize ourselves with the div tag. The `<div>` element is the generic container and does not inherently represent anything. Use it on group elements for purposes such as styling, marking a section of a document in a different language, and so on.

Here is an example of usage:

```markup
 <div>
   <p>Any kind of content here. Such as
   &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;. You name it!</p>
 </div>
```

Preview:

Any kind of content here. Such as \, \. You name it!
