# PHP

## Reading PHP source

* If we can read arbitrary files, why not see what the webserver is doing?
* ../../../var/www/html/index.php
* However the results are a mess!
* This is because the webserver still recognizes &lt;?php ?&gt; tags and will execute them as code instead of displaying them
* How can we get around this restriction?

## PHP filters

* If we don’t let the webserver see the php tags, we can exfiltrate the source code
* So we need to encode it somehow…
* PHP filters can actually convert the file into base64!
* php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=file
* There are other useful PHP filters\(like zipping/unzipping\) that could help you bypass security checks and exfiltrate/execute files
