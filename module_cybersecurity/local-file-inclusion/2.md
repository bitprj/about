# Local File Inclusion

## What is local file inclusion \(LFI\)?

Check the vulnerable webapp first

Info for people following along AFTER the workshop:

Two containers are still running on ports 10001 and 10002. If you want to use them, feel free to ask me to reset them for you.

## No such file or directory…?

* The most important thing when pentesting a system is to see how it behaves when given unexpected input
* If we enter a name that is not in the roster, we get a “file not found” error
* This means it’s very likely that the server is just opening a file and sending us the contents

## ../profit

* From the error we can see the server is reading files from /home/professor/grades
* Can we access other files on the system?
* /home/professor/grades/../../../etc/passwd
* If you don’t have the error logs, don’t worry! The root directory still has a .. that points to itself, so just rack up a bajillion ../../../s

## What next?

* We can read arbitrary files on the system! What should we read though?
* /etc/passwd
* * Contains user account info
* /etc/\[random config files\]
* * If file found, the system has that service installed
  * Could also give you useful info
* /proc/self/
* * This is a bit advanced, but you theoretically could gain RCE using /proc/self/environ, read own memory from /proc/self/mem, etc
* Source code and log files
* * We will cover these two in more detail
