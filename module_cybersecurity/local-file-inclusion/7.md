# Jackpot!

* We got a reverse shell and the second flag!
* The third flag is hidden deeper, but I won’t tell you where it is just yet. Happy hunting!
* To summarize, we found a vulnerability where we can read arbitrary files, used it to extract information from the system, and eventually gained RCE from access.log
* If you are a developer
* * ALWAYS sanitize your inputs!
  * Don’t just run dangerous functions like include\(\) with user input
  * Consider moving your log files to a non-standard location
