# RCE through log files

* So we got the source code, but nothing interesting inside.
* Can we turn our LFI into an RCE?
* If you read the log file, the server prints out a bunch of stuff, including our user agent
* What if our user agent is “&lt;?php pwn\(\); ?&gt;”
* This is the part where you can mess up. If you make a request like this using syntactically incorrect PHP code, it can make this attack undoabe. Tell me if you need the container reset!
* &lt;?php echo exec\(‘id’\) ?&gt;
