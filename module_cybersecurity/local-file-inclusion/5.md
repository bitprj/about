# Reverse shell

* We can execute code on the server!
* Use the skills from the last workshop and get yourself a reverse shell!
* If you need a refresher or just some common reverse shells: [http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) or just google “reverse shell cheat sheet”
* I recommend using the php one since we know php is on the system, but we are not sure if other tools are\(you can always use the which command to check\)
