How to attack and own a machine running vulnerable services

## What is command injection?

* Check the vulnerable webapp first
* [http://daviscybersec.ddns.net:8079/commandinjection.php](http://daviscybersec.ddns.net:8079/commandinjection.php)
* The webserver is probably executing something like “calculator {INPUT}”
* What happens if your input contains weird characters?
* “calculator 1+1 ; evil\_command”
* Both commands get executed!
* There are many ways to detect command injection vulns, most importantly throw “metacharacters” at it \(e.g. quotes and semicolons\)
* The same concept is used for other injections like SQL injection

DISCLAIMER:

You WILL be gaining root access on the server, so please be courteous of others. Don’t be a jerk and run ‘rm -rf /’, or put rootkits, or add junk into .bashrc, or add this device to your botnet collection, etc. All other devices on the network is out of bounds, too.

SSH into [revshell@daviscybersec.ddns.net](mailto:revshell@daviscybersec.ddns.net)

Password: daviscybersec

You can listen on ports on 192.168.1.200 to the vulnerable webservice.

Server you are attacking:

[http://daviscybersec.ddns.net:8079/commandinjection.php](http://daviscybersec.ddns.net:8079/commandinjection.php)

Try injecting commands, get a reverse shell, and gain root!
