# Getting a “shell”

* Now that you got a connection, you might notice it’s an ugly shell
* No tab complete, arrow keys don’t work, Ctrl+C kills the reverse shell instead, can’t execute commands like vi or nano...
* This is because:
* * No PTY \(feel free to read more on your own\)
  * Your terminal is not sending raw characters
  * The remote server does not know how your terminal works or how big it is
* Tricks:
* * python -c “import pty;pty.spawn\(‘/bin/bash’\)”
  * * this allows you to run a shell with a pty
  * Ctrl+Z to background nc, “stty raw -echo”, “fg”
  * * This allows your own terminal to send control sequences\(like Ctrl+C\) “raw” to nc
    * When you type “fg” these characters won’t appear on the terminal, it’s normal
  * Let the remote server know what terminal you’re using
  * * export TERM=?????
    * * You would have to find ????? by running “echo $TERM” on your own shell
    * \(optional\) stty rows ?? cols ??
    * * So commands use the whole screen

## Finally, an actual shell! Now what?

* Now that we have a complete shell, how should we proceed?
* * We are currently www-data which can’t do a lot
  * How about trying to gain root instead?
* More enumeration
* * Sensitive files with insecure permissions?
  * Hidden files? Like passwords.txt
  * More services on the inside you can exploit?
  * Cron jobs as other users?
  * SUID binaries? \(more on that later\)
  * Improper sudo privileges?
