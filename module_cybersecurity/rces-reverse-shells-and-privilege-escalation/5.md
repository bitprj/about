# Jackpot!

* We just found something by running sudo -l
* What is setcap anyways?
* Some of you might be familiar with the SUID/SGID bit
* * You thought there are 9 permission bits? there are actually 12!
  * Three hidden bits, which allow the binary to be run as another user
  * This is useful for example on ping binaries, ping actually requires root privileges to run, so it’s SUID on some old systems
  * * This also means if you find a bug in the ping binary, you can exploit it and get root!

## Capabilities

* Since SUID binaries are such a huge vulnerability, modern linux systems have something called “capabilities” instead
* ping now has CAP\_NET\_RAW which allows it to send raw network packets
* There are lots of capabilities, but the interesting one here is CAP\_SETUID
* It allows the binary to set it’s user ID as anything! Including 0, which is root!
* How can we exploit this?

## Writing a SUID shell

* Go into /tmp, make a directory for yourself so you won’t interfere with others
* Write a C program that calles setuid\(0\); then executes /bin/sh
* Compile
* Use the sudo vulnerability you just found and allow it to SUID to root
* Run it!
