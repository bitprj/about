* This is called RCE, or Remote Command Execution. Basically you can execute arbitrary commands on the server
* This is extremely dangerous for the server, good news for the hackers
* To defend against such attacks, remember to validate your inputs!

## What next?

* * What privilege do you have?
* uname -a
* * Distro? Kernel version? Kernel exploits?
* cat /etc/passwd
* * What users are on the system?
* netstat -auntp
