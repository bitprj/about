## What is SQL?

* Structured Query Language
* Common language used to talk to a database
* * A lot of databases support the basic SQL syntax, from mysql/mariadb to postgresql to mssql…
* You can SELECT rows from “tables”
* * Each table has rows and columns. If you have a table of students, each row would be a student, and you would have columns like “first\_name”, “last\_name”, “age”, etc.
  * Syntax: SELECT column1,column2 FROM table;
  * * This returns column1 and column2 from every row available
  * You can also filter the SELECT output
  * * SELECT \* FROM users WHERE username=”blah” AND is\_admin=1;
* You can also modify the database by using UPDATE and INSERT statements, but we don’t need to use it today.
* Capitalization of commands like SELECT don’t matter.

## What is SQL injection?

* If you have a database of stuff you want to search through, you might be tempted to write SELECT \* FROM table WHERE data=’$query’
* * where $query is the user input
* But what if the user input is not sanitized correctly?
* If $query contains a single quote, we can escape from the “data=” part and do whatever we want!
* If $query is abc’ OR otherstuff=’1
* SELECT \* FROM table WHERE data=’abc’ OR otherstuff=’1’
* * Perfectly well-structured command! SQL will happily execute that.
