# Breaking into a login page

* Vulnerable service: [https://sqli.rkevin.dev/](https://sqli.rkevin.dev/)
* * Initial page load will take ~10s, be patient!
* This login page, like some other badly written ones, tries to select rows from a database of users that match the username and password. If there are no matches, you can’t login.
* Can you think of a way to break it?
* BTW, something convenient: You can end your query using a semicolon, then using “-- “ to comment out the junk after the statement \(like // in C\)
* * Note the space after the “-- “! “--” will fail but “-- “ will work
* Hint: The query being executed is
* * SELECT \* FROM users WHERE username=’$username’ AND password=’$pass’
