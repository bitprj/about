# Summary

* SQL is extremely common, and it’s very important to implement it right.
* How can we defend against this?
* * SANITIZE USER INPUT!
  * * This applies not only to SQL, not only to webapp development, but literally everything
    * When you think about it, all exploits are bad users giving unexpected input :p
  * Prepared statements
  * * There’s a way to tell MySQL to make a “prepared statement”
    * SELECT \* FROM users WHERE username=?
    * The ? is filled in by MySQL, no injections here no matter what bad characters are there.
