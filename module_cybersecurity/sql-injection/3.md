# Enumerating the database

* We’re in! Also we can see some output from the database. How can we use this to exfiltrate information from the database?
* UNION
* * This is a SQL command that “joins” two SELECT statements and gives back the results
  * SELECT col1,col2 FROM table1 UNION SELECT col3,col4 FROM table2
  * Caveat is both SELECT statements must return the same amount of columns
* You can also SELECT “constants”
* * SELECT 1,2,username FROM users
  * * Will return 3 columns, the first two are hardcoded 1 and 2 for all the rows.
* Knowing all this, and if I tell you the usernames and passwords are stored in a table called “users”, can you exfiltrate all the user info?
* We got some usernames and passwords! However, we just guessed the table name and the column names. Who knows what kind of stuff is hidden in the database…
* information\_schema
* * This is a special database that contains all the information for all other databases and tables!
  * If you know the underlying database \(MariaDB\) you can just Google to see how its structured.
* information\_schema.tables
* * Contains info on all tables in the system
  * Two important columns: table\_name, table\_schema
  * * table\_name is \(duh\) the table name, table\_schema is which database the table is in
* information\_schema.columns
* * column\_name, table\_name
  * * You can also use WHERE statements to filter by table\_name
