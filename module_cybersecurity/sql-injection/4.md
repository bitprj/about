# File inclusion

* We can read any table in the system. Can we read more?
* MariaDB/MySQL has a load\_file function
* * Other databases like PostgreSQL have similar functions, even up to RCE
  * If you’re running a database, MAKE SURE no one can access it! It could mean more than just your database being compromised.
* We can probably dump the PHP code and see how the webapp works!
* * The third and last flag \(for this challenge\) is waiting for you…
  * NOTE: The default Apache webpages are served from /var/www/html
  * NOTE: Ignore the /webchal/lfi part, the files are in places like /var/www/html/index.php
* You can also write to files, although you can’t append or overwrite files
* * Google to see more information!
  * I’m not sure how to get RCE from this, but if you can figure it out I’d like to know!
