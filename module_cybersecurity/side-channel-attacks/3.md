# Brute forcing the secret

* Now we know how long the length is, we can brute force the secret character by character!

## Overview

* We just exploited a \(admittedly bad\) version of strcmp!
* How can you, as a developer, defend against side channels?
* * Leak less information
  * * e.g. restrict physical access
  * Obfuscate the side channel
  * * e.g. adding artificial delays
    * * Linux pam does this
