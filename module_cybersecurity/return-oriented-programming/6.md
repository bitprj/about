# Return Oriented Programming

* By chaining a chunk of code that sets rdi, with a chunk of code that uses it to execute /bin/bash, we have gained code execution!
* * We didn’t limit ourselves and jumped to the _middle_ of functions, using snippets of code to do whatever we want to do \(in this case, set %rdi\).
  * These snippets of code are called “gadgets”. A gadget is just a snippet of code that ends in “ret”, so you can chain them together.
* The more complex a binary is, the more gadgets there are.
* * In fact, libc \(the library that has printf, scanf, fopen and all the functions you know and love\) has so many gadgets in it, it is actually turing complete!
* In fact, if you have a binary using libc, you don’t even _need_ a target function!
* * system, execve, syscall rop gadget…
  * This is called a ret2libc attack
