# Return Oriented Programming

Return Oriented Programming

* Remember last time we solved x86\_bufov\_args, and I told you it’s not possible in 64-bit?
* * I lied. We’re gonna exploit 2\_x64\_bufov\_args together today! Source code is bufov\_args.c
* The main obstacle for us last time was the x64 calling convention, which puts the arguments in registers rather than on the stack.
* * We can’t modify registers just by controlling the stack… unless we redirect code execution to some piece of code that _can_ control the registers.
* Remember, our goal is to: put the right argument in %rdi, and run target
* * So, if we can find a “function” to move what we want into %rdi, we’re golden!
  * * Something along the lines of “pop %rdi” would be cool….
* What if I tell you there is a code section that looks like this:
* * 0x401273: pop %rdi
  * 0x401274: ret
* Does this allow you to put something in %rdi and jump to target?
* * Try it for yourself first before I reveal the solution.
