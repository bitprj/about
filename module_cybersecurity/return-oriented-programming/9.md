# Summary

* Last week we learned unprotected buffers are BAD. Now they’re WORSE!
* If an attacker finds your stack buffer overflow, they can get remote code execution even if your functions don’t do anything malicious!
* * They can just find enough ROP gadgets to screw you over.
* Protections?
* * Same stuff as last time, ASLR, canaries, etc, but the best protection is still to write better code.
  * Code like you’re being attacked, because you will be.
