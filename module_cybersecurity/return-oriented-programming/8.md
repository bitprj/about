# Exploiting a ret2libc Attack

* \*Note: This is technically not a ret2libc attack since I linked libc statically to the binary. Close enough.
* Before you tackle a true ret2libc attack that requires a gadget, try 3\_x86\_ret2libc\_static \(source file is ret2libc.c\)
* * This is a x86 binary with “system” inside. Try to call it with the right arguments!
* Now that you have an exploit working for 32bit, try 4\_x64\_ret2libc\_static! \(also compiled from ret2libc.c\)
* * Other than adjusting offsets, the biggest thing you need to do is to find a gadget to put your argument in rdi. Good luck!
* Once you have your exploit ready, exploit twinpeaks.rkevin.dev port 30054 and grab the flag!
* If we have time or you want to explore more advanced usages of ret2libc, try 5\_x64\_ret2libc\_harder\_static!
* * You don’t have the findme variable anymore, so you’ll have to write your own on the stack, like last time’s 6\_x86\_bufov\_args\_harder!
  * * ASLR is disabled. For consistent results, run ./noaslr ./5\_x64\_ret2libc\_harder\_static
  * You don’t have the “system” function like before. You’ll have to find some other way to execute /bin/bash.
  * * I used the execve syscall. Hint: Look up how x86\_64 syscalls work, and try to issue an execve syscall. For reference, my ropchain had 4 gadgets, not counting setting up some regions of memory.
  * It’s a lot, but if you have time to work through this you will gain a lot of understanding of how ROP and syscalls work! Service is at twinpeaks.rkevin.dev port 30055.
  * * And I might buy you dinner if you get the flag. _might_.
