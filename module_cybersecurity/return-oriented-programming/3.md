# Chaining functions

* Notice that after callmefirst has done its job, it does what every function does: look for the “saved return value” on the stack.
* * Can you use this to figure out how to call the three functions one after the other?
* You might have noticed we are sort of “programming” on the stack!
* * You gave instructions to the program to execute some functions in order by modifying return addresses and chaining the “ret”s at the end of the functions together.
  * This is _almost_ return-oriented programming
* However, we had one arbitrary limitation, we tried to jump to beginnings of functions that exist…
* * but what if we can jump to the middle of functions?
