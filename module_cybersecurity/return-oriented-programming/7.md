# Finding ROP Gadgets

* Before you go on and do your own exploits, there’s one final thing…
* * I gave you the answer for where the crucial ROP gadget is, but how can you find it yourself?
* There’s a useful tool called \(for obvious reasons\) “ROPgadget”
* * pip install ropgadget
* You can ask ROPgadget to list stuff of interest by using:
* * ROPgadget --binary executable\_to\_analyze
  * Then you can grep for the stuff you might need
