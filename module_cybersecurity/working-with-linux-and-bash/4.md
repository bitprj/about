# Linux file permissions

All files have an owner and a set of “permissions” telling the system who is allowed to access what. They’re usually expressed in 3 octal numbers \(ranging from 0~7\), so 000 ~ 777

* Each number specifies “read”, “write” and “execute” permissions
  * Read=4, write=2, execute=1
* If you see 5, 5=4+1 so it corresponds to read and execute. 0 is no permissions, 7 is all

Each of the three numbers specify what the owner, group and world can do

* You can check this info in ‘ls -l’ or ‘stat’ commands
* This is all very abstract, so let’s go through an example!

## Commands to Use

chmod

* Changes permissons of a file
  * Multiple usages
  * chmod 755 file
  * chmod u-x file
  * check the man page for them all!

chown

* Changes owner and group of a file
  * Usually only doable as root \(unless you’re the owner and in the group you want to change to\)
    * chown user:group file
