# Advanced bash skills

You can “chain” commands together using “pipes”, \|

* command 1 \| command 2 \| command 3
  * This links the output of command 1 into the input of command 2, and so on
* This allows many possibilities!
* Trying to find a running process?
  * ps aux \| grep command
* Trying to find something only in the first 300 lines of a file?
  * head -n300 file \| grep something
* You can also “background” processes while they’re running!
* If you want to run something while another command is running, you don’t have to kill that command!
  * Press Ctrl+Z, which “stops” the command
  * Type ‘fg’ to bring it back to the foreground again!
  * Type ‘bg’ to resume it running, but still free up the shell to execute other commands
* Use the ‘jobs’ command to view all the stopped/backgrounded jobs on the system
* Use ‘fg \[number\]’ or ‘bg \[number\]’ to resume that particular job
