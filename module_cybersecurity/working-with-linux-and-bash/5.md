# User information

We kept talking about ‘owners’ and ‘root’, what are they? Users on a system

You can check which user you are using the ‘id’ or ‘whoami’ commands. You can also view the info of other users by looking at the file /etc/passwd. User IDs are the most important part. UID 0 is root.

## Groups

* ‘id’ tells you what groups you are in
* Useful when you want, say, 5 people to modify one file but none of the others
  * chmod 664 file

You can also look in /etc/group
