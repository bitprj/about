# Talking to Remote Servers

Intro on how to use nmap, nc and pwntools

## Setup

Install the following tools: nmap, nc, python

And install the python package “pwntools”

Ask me if you have any problems installing any of these.

If you want a head start, run nmap on daviscybersec.ddns.net

Try using nc to send an HTTP request to port 80, then use python to write scripts that exploit ports 1337 and 1338.

## What are ports?

* A way for one server to run multiple services at once
* One service runs on one port, and you talk to the service by connecting to that port
* There are 65535 of them, and there are conventions on which port is used for what, but it’s not enforced
* * For example, port 80 is commonly used for HTTP, 22 is for SSH, 443 is for HTTPS, 53 is for DNS, etc.
