# Assembly x86 Calling Conventions

Letâ€™s make some programs and see how calling works when compiled by GCC.

* Different compilers will give different disassemblies, but the convention should be the same. 

Take a look at calling\_convention.c and 1\_x86\_convention.

* main:
* * 0x80491b1: call test1
  * 0x80491b6: some other instruction
* test1:
* * 0x8049166: push %ebp
  * 0x8049167: mov %esp, %ebp
  * 0x8049169: nop
  * 0x804916a: pop %ebp
  * 0x804916b: ret
