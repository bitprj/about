# x86 Calling Conventions

* To summarize, arguments to the function are pushed onto the stack by the caller, and the callee just reads “behind” its base pointer to see its arguments. After the call, the caller clears out these values from the stack.
* * Notice the arguments are pushed on in _reverse_ order
* We’re almost there.
* Let’s take a look at the last thing: local variables on the stack.
* * I don’t have any space to add commentary on the slides, so I’ll just be talking. If you’re looking at the slides after the workshop, I’ve put some notes in the speaker notes box below.
