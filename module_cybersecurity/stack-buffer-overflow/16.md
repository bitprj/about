# Summary

* Unprotected buffers are BAD!
* * We explored how overwriting stuff on the stack can lead to running code on a vulnerable server, but other types of overflows \(e.g. heap\) are equally as bad!
* Protections?
* * Write secure code! Never trust user input, filter stuff properly, check length, etc.
  * System/hardware level protections: ASLR, canaries, shadowstackâ€¦
  * This is an old problem, so there are many solutions, each of them are worth talking about some other time.
