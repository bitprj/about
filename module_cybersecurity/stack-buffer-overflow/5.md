# x86 Calling Conventions

* When you call a function, the “return address” \(aka where you would continue executing\) is pushed onto the stack
* * This way the function you’re calling knows where to continue execution once it’s finished
* esp \(stack pointer\) and ebp \(base pointer\) are kept the same before and after the function call
* * There are some other registers that are supposed to be the same, but it’s not important here
* Let’s take a look at test2, which is nearly the same as test1, but it’s important to understand this part first so let’s go through the example again.
