# Call Conventions

Last time we took a look at how to understand program logic from the disassembly, but we didn’t explore how functions are called

* You probably saw instructions like “call printf” but there are no arguments passed in. What’s up with that?

Down at the assembly level, “function calls” are just a construct

* There are instructions like “call” and “ret”, but they are still just register and stack manipulation
  * “call addr” is equivalent to “push %rip, mov addr, %rip”
  * “ret” is equivalent to “pop %rip”
  * Remember “rip” is the instruction pointer, so it stores where the CPU is gonna run next, so setting “rip” means start executing the next instruction from there

We can make up some agreed-upon conventions to help make our lives easier when defining and calling functions.

* GCC takes care of this when compiling, just like how it takes care of other constructs like variables

Usually you don’t have to consider it, but we will take a deeper look at how the calling works and see if we can exploit it

* Warning: x86 call conventions are different from x86\_64 call conventions. We’re gonna explore both today
