# Buffer Overflow

* We saw several things when learning about the call conventions:
* * Where we should jump to next is just stored on the stack, like any other value
  * Local variables are stored “before” the return address
* Can we exploit this somehow?
* Consider this piece of code:
* * char buf\[16\];
  * scanf\(“%s”, buf\);
* Could this cause any problems?
* Hint: The stack looks like this:
* If we write more data than the program expects, we can overwrite the saved return address and gain control of the program’s execution!

| Buffer \(local variable\) |
| :--- |
| ... |
| Buffer \(local variable\) |
| Saved ebp |
| Saved return address |
| … \(all the other stuff\) |

* Let’s try exploiting this “control flow hijack” vulnerability.
* * It’s called this because we gain control of “eip”, which controls where the program executes next. If we hijack eip, we hijack what the program is gonna execute next.
* Take a look at 3\_x86\_bufov\_noargs, and think about how you can exploit it
* * Try entering some crap into it and see how it behaves!
* If you enter in a long string, you will see the program crashes! Let’s investigate where it crashed...
* As you can see, our instruction pointer got overwritten to our input! Why does this happen? Let’s look at the disassembly again...
