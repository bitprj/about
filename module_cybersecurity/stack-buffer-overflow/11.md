# x86 Calling Conventions

* For each function, the local variables are stored on the stack “before” the return address and stored base pointer. Here’s a quick summary of what the stack looks like from the caller and callee’s perspective.

| First argument \(esp\) |
| :--- |
| ... |
| Last argument |
| Caller’s stuff |
| Caller’s stuff \(ebb\) |

Caller, right before the “call” instruction

| Local variable \(...\) \(ESP\) |
| :--- |
| Local variable \(ebb\) |
| Saved ebp |
| Saved return address |
| First argument |
| … \(all the other arguments\) |
