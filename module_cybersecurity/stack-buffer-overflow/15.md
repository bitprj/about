# Congrats!

* You have just exploited your first\* buffer overflow vulnerability!
* * \*unless it is not your first
* Now that you know the process, try it on the 64-bit environment!
* * 4\_x64\_bufov\_noargs
  * Remember, the main difference between x64 and x86 calling convention is that the stack is aligned to 8 bytes at a time, not 4!
* Once you have perfected your exploit, send it to twinpeaks.rkevin.dev port 30051
* Depending on time, we might have to call it a day here. If we do have time though, try 5\_x86\_bufov\_args!
* * This time, you are required to pass in an argument to the target function. How would you do that?
* Exploit the server: twinpeaks.rkevin.dev port 30052
  * Hint: What does the target function expect the stack to look like once execution is passed into it?

| … unallocated space yet |
| :---: |
| “Saved return address” \(or so it thinks\) \(esp\) |
| First argument \(or so it thinks\) |
| … \(all the other arguments\) |

* If you want a final challenge, try 6\_x86\_bufov\_args\_harder!
* * You need to figure out a way to put your own string on the stack, then give the “target” function a pointer to it.
  * Note: Run the program using “./noaslr ./6\_x86\_bufov\_args\_harder” to disable some protections against this type of attack. Make sure the filenames match exactly since the stack locations might be different if you don’t, so you can’t exploit it on the remote server.
* Exploit the server: twinpeaks.rkevin.dev port 30053
