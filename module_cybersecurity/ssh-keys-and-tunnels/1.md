# SSH Keys and Tunnels

How to make SSH easy and move laterally through a network

## Setup

Mac/Linux/WSL: No setup!

You have SSH already.

Windows: You can install OpenSSH Client as an optional feature in Win10.

Try copying your SSH keys to revshell@daviscybersec.ddns.net

Password: fluidly81Built97allows

SSH into: james@daviscybersec.ddns.net

Password: raze11Plastron70Mounded

Pivot to another machine and access the control panel.

## Secure SHell

* Most people here should be fairly familiar with what SSH is
* * You probably have used it to access the CSIF before
* Quick refresher:
* * ssh user@machine
  * Enter your password and you are in!

## Why SSH keys

* What if you have different SSH servers with different credentials?
* What if you want to login without a password and still have it secure?
* You can create a SSH key pair, put your public key on the SSH server, and you can now login easily!
