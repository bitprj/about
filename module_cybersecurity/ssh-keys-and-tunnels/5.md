# Local port forwarding

* To do local port forwarding:
* * ssh -L port:host:hostport user@server
  * port is a port on your local machine
  * host:hostport is the destination you are connecting to
  * For example, -L 1234:10.0.0.1:5678 will make it so that whenever you access port 1234 on your local computer, it would be like the server accessed port 5678 on the computer 10.0.0.1
  * I admit this is kind of confusing, but the next slide should clear it up.

## -L 1234:10.0.0.1:5678
