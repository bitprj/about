# Steps

## 1\) Generating the keys

* ssh-keygen
* * Follow the prompt and generate your keys
  * By default, your public key will be at ~/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub and your private key is at ~/.ssh/id\_rsa
  * You don’t have to specify a password, and SSHing into other machines won’t require passwords either
  * * Do be careful though, if someone steals your id\_rsa, your servers are doomed!

## 2\) Putting it on the server

* We are using the reverse shell user as an example
* * If you have access to the CSIF, I highly recommend trying it there
* ssh-copy-id user@server
* * This creates a ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys file on the server and adds your id\_rsa.pub file in there
  * When you login next, your server will do fancy maths to verify you have the private key based on the authorized\_keys file

## 3\) Profit

* Try SSHing into the server again. Notice you don’t have to type in the user’s password!
* Just to recap:
* * On your own computer:
  * * id\_rsa
    * id\_rsa.pub
  * On the server:
  * * authorized\_keys \(contains id\_rsa.pub\)

## 4\) SSH Config files

* Try creating a config file in your computer’s .ssh folder and write the following:
* * Host revshell
  * * HostName daviscybersec.ddns.net
    * User revshell
* This makes it so you can type “ssh revshell” to SSH in the server.
* Be careful: this is convenient, but someone who sees the file will know you have access to a particular server.
