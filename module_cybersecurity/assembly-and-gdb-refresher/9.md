# Reverse Engineering

## What is reverse engineering?

## Using Ghidra

Try to use Ghidra on ‘7\_reverse\_engineering’, figure out what it does and grab the flag!

* Hint: Once you figured stuff out, it might be helpful to use GDB and dump intermediate values without worrying about where those values came from

Remember, always be alert of **ifs**, **loops** and **function calls**! Good luck!
