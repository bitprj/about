# Assembly and GDB Refresher

Understanding the inner workings of an executable

## What is assembly?

Your CPU doesn’t understand C or Python or anything like that. It’s very dumb and can only run “machine code”, a set of binary instructions that runs on the “barebones” metal.

Assembly is a “human-readable” version of machine code. For example, a “mov %rbx,%rax” instruction in assembly is “48 89 d8” in machine code

In general, all other programming languages need to be converted to assembly at some point, and an assembler converts it into machine code, which your CPU runs.
