# Ghidra

Now that we have a taste of what it’s like to read the raw assembly and understanding what programs do, let’s bring out the big guns!

Ghidra is a reverse engineering tool with lots of features, including decompilation! It’s a much, much, much more souped-up version of objdump

You can install it from [https://ghidra-sre.org/](https://ghidra-sre.org/)

## Using Ghidra on the earlier binaries

Try opening 4\_strcmp and 5\_reading\_memory in Ghidra and see what you get!

As you can see this makes our lives a _lot_ easier
