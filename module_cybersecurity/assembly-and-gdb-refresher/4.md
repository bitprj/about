# Basic assembly instructions

Let’s take a look at some actual assembly code!

The tool ‘objdump’ dumps assembly from an executable binary. Try running ‘objdump -d 1\_basic’ to dump its assembly.

* We’re only interested in the ‘main’ section

Open ‘1\_basic.c’ side by side to compare the assembly and the C source code!

## Basic Instructions

* mov src,dest : Moves src into dest \(note the order!\)
* call addr: Calls the function at addr, with the arguments passed through registers
* Fetching the value in a memory address
* -0x4\(%rbp\) means go to the address %rbp-4, and grab the value there

Note: This is where x86 and x64 differ, but we’ll go through that and what ‘call’ does exactly in the next workshop!

Now let’s check the disassembly for 2\_if

* cmp a,b: Does b-a and stores “flags” about the calculation
* jl: Jump if last cmp was less than zero
* jg: Jump if greater
* jle/jge: Jump if less/greater than or equal

## Loops

‘objdump -d 3\_loop’ What does a loop look like in assembly? start of loop: loop\_body cmp ?,? jump to start of loop if sth happens after\_loop

In general, when you’re reversing a binary, it’s very important to watch for call and jump instructions Instructions like mov, lea, push and pull are linear, but jumps and calls indicate logic like if statements and loops
