Define a method to search the entire list, and call it **search\(\)**. It requires one parameter: the value to be searched for. You will need to compare that value with each value in the linked list until you find it or go out of bounds.

If you find the node with the specific value you're searching for, return the Boolean value `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
