We should reverse the list because why not?

Let's try to define a function called **reverse\(\)** that reverses the order of your current list, so the head becomes the tail and vice versa.

For example, if you have a list as below:

\[head: 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6 -&gt; tail: 7\]

The new list after being reversed will be:

\[head:7 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; tail: 1\]

You should traverse the new list and print out the element for verification.

However, if your current doubly linked list is empty, there are no elements to be reversed so you should return.
