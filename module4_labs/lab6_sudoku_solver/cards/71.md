Here are some specific hints about how to approach this problem:

* You will have to figure out a way to preserve the state of the grid, even when we are storing the value `n` at the row, column pair \(`r`, `c`\). This is needed to ensure the board maintains itself, even if the user guesses wrong. \(Hint: duplication of the board\)
* Additionally, you will have to check if the user's guess is correct. You should be using a function you _completed_ \(big hint\) earlier as part of achieving this. Also consider how you will update the grid if a solution has been found. 

To duplicate the board we can use the built-in function `copy.deepcopy()`, which we must import the Python library `copy`.

Once we input the user's guess into the duplicated board, we need to check if the duplicate will succeed. This is done through our function `complete()`, which takes as arguments the grid \(the duplicate in this case\) and the integer `depth`. We will do this in an if-statement.

If the condition succeeds, then all we need to do left is check if `finish` is true. If so, then we will copy `duplicate` back to grid since we now have a solution!
