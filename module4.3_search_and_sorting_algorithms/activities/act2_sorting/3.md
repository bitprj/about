# Bubble Sort Implementation in Python

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
```

Let's start with writing a function. We want to first identify the length of our list for when we start comparing elements. In the beginning, the length will simply be the original size of the list, but with every iteration this length will grow smaller. This is because as we fully sort more and more numbers, we reduce the number of elements we need to compare and swap the next time.

```python
    for i in range(n):
           if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
```

Here, we look at and compare two elements in our range. If the current element is smaller than the element next to it, they need to be swapped. Again, we are trying to sort an array of numbers from smallest to largest.

```python
               temp = bubble[i]
               bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
               bubble[i+1] = temp
```

This is a classic swap procedure that switches two elements in a list. We first make a temporary copy of the current element and store its value. Then, we set the value of the current element to the next element's value. Finally, we set the next element's value to the current element's _original_ value, which we still have from our copy.

We will continue comparing and swapping every pair of numbers until the entire list is sorted from smallest to largest.

```python
def bubbleSort(bubble):
   for n in range(len(bubble)-1,0,-1):
    for i in range(n):
       if bubble[i] > bubble[i+1]:
           temp = bubble[i]
           bubble[i] = bubble[i+1]
           bubble[i+1] = temp

bubble = [14,46,43,27,57,41,45,21,70]
bubbleSort(bubble)
print(bubble)
```

To test if our sort function works, we can create a sample list and run our function.
