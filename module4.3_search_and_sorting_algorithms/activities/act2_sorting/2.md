# Bubble Sort Theory

Bubble Sort is considered to be one of the simplest sorting algorithms. The name comes from the fact that this method compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they're not in order. This makes larger values "bubble to the top" \(to the very end of the list\), giving us a fully sorted list in the end.

Lets break up this process into its logical steps, using the list shown above:

1. Compare the first two numbers, if they are not sorted \(the larger number comes before the smaller number\), then swap the two. This assumes that you want the list elements to be sorted from smallest to largest. In our list, 6 comes before 5, so we swap the two. The list now looks like this:

2. Move on from the first and compare the second and third values, swap if necessary. In our case, 6 now comes before 3 so we swap again:

3. Continue down the list until reaching the last element. At this point the largest value has been sorted. In our example, 8 is the largest number. So at this point, 8 should now be at the very last position of the list:

4. We finished the first pass of the list. Now, we start over again from the first number, 5 in our case, and repeat steps 1-3. This time, however, we continue down the list to the _second-to-last_ element. This is because we can see that 8 is in the position it should be. It doesn't need to be swapped anymore. We then repeat the whole process until we arrive at the fully sorted list that we want:
