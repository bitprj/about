# Merge Sort Theory

If we pretend we have to sort a deck of cards, Mergesort can be thought of as dividing up the work by cutting the deck into smaller, more manageable groups and rearranging the cards before bringing it all back together.

This algorithm is a little different from the previous algorithms we learned earlier since it requires dividing up the list into smaller parts before sorting everything together. We'll use a sample list again to show the workings of each concrete step:

1. First, divide the list in half, or something close to it. It's alright if one half is bigger. This is just because there was an odd number of elements in our list. After this first division, our sample list now looks like this:

2. Keep dividing up each list in half until every original element is by itself:

3. Now, try and pair elements together in order. Here, we are trying to sort from smallest to largest. In our sample list, the `7` will have to be by itself:

4. Now we move on to pairing groups of elements. We make sure to sort all the elements first before combining them. After this step, our sample list will first look like this:

   Now, we simply do one more sort-and-combine step to get our fully sorted list:
