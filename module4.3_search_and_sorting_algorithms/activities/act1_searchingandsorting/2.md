**Breadth-First Search**

Let's take a deeper look at how BFS works.

**Step 1**: We start by creating a queue. It's important that we use a queue here because we want to take advantage of the first-in, first-out structure. We want the first vertex we visit in a layer \(and add to the queue\) to be the next vertex we pop from the queue, so we can look at its adjacent vertices next. This upholds the breadth-first, or layered, traversal.

**Step 2**: We start at the first vertex and mark it as visited.

**Steps 3-5**: We then begin to look at the adjacent vertices. We push all of the connected vertices to the queue, marking each as visited as we go.

**Step 6**: Once we've added each vertex in the layer, we pop from the queue, and begin the same process with the first vertex we pushed.

**Step 7**: We push any adjacent vertices of the vertex we just popped, and mark them as visited.

We continue this process, popping from the queue and checking for adjacent vertices, until the queue is empty. After all the vertices in the tree have been pushed to the queue, we keep popping from the queue. Since all the vertices have been visited, no new vertices will be pushed, and the queue will be cleared.
