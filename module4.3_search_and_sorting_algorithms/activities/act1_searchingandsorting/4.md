**Depth First Search** \(**DFS**\), similar to the **Breadth-First Search** \(**BFS**\) we just explored, is an algorithm for traversing tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node \(selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph\) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This is different from BFS, where we went across layers of nodes. With DFS, we traverse 'downwards' as far as possible before going back up to the rest of the vertices.

As in the example given above, DFS algorithm traverses from S to A to D to G to E to B first, then to F and lastly to C. It employs the following rules.

* **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.
* **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. \(It will pop up all the vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.\)
* **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.

With DFS we will also employ **recursion**, the act of calling a function within itself. It seems counterintuitive at first, but the function can be called within itself, which is useful to continue using the function until some condition is reached.
