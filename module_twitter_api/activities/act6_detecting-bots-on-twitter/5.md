## Making a Bar Graph

After getting all the data set up, let's plot it.

Add this code in the same file you were just writing previous code on.

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (15,15)) // indicates the size of plot
index = np.arange(25) 
plt.bar(index, dict_values, edgecolor = 'black', linewidth=1)
plt.xlabel('Most active Users', fontsize = 18) // label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel('NÂº of Tweets', fontsize=20) // label y for the x-axis
plt.xticks(index,dict_keys, fontsize=15, rotation=90)
plt.title('Number of tweets for the most active users', fontsize = 20)
plt.savefig('Tweets_of_active_users.jpg')
plt.show()
```

The figsize indicates the size of the plot. Since we have the top 25 users, we will make 25 evenly spaced spots on the graph for each of them using the arange\(\) function. The xlabel\(\) and ylabel\(\) respectively sets the label of the axises while Xticks will set ticks marks for on the axises for your graph. Savefig will save this plot straight into a .jpg file given a title. Finally, show\(\) will print out your graph!

All of the functions are from the matplotlib library except arange\(\) which is from numpy.

When ran, you should have something like this.

In this example plot we have here, we can see @CrytoKaku seems to have been the most active. Could he/she be a bot?
