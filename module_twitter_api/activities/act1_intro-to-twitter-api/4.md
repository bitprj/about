# Streaming and Processing Class

In this part of the activity, we will now start writing the code for the Tweepy application. Start off by creating a new Python file named **tweepy\_streamer.py**.

1. Next, we will import the Tweepy module, which you should have installed in the previous part of the activity, into the file to allow us to use its commands in our file. Import the module at the very top of your Python file.

```python
from tweepy.streaming import StreamListener
from tweepy import OAuthHandler
from tweepy import Stream
import twitter_credential
```

Libraries are a kind of resource that programmers used to write their code. It's pre-written code open for the public to use. There are libraries specific to a language but a lot of APIs have their own libraries too. For exmaple, Tweepy is a big libraries that holds many other libraries like StreamListener that we used above.

1. Moving along, we will create a **TwitterStreamer** class to stream and process live tweets. Then, define a class method to stream in the tweets called **stream\_tweets**. This method will take in self, fetched\_tweets\_filename, and hash\_tag\_list. The fetched\_tweets\_filename parameter will be the text file name where your tweet data will be stored and the hash\_tag\_list parameter will be the hashtag filtering keyword.

```python
class TwitterStreamer():
  def stream_tweets(self, fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

A class, made in the code above, is group of user-defined functions that all apply to on specific "object".

For example, say we have a Car class. What does a car do? It drives, its brakes, it has an odometer, and features. If we were to make a Car class it would have functions and variables holding all the intrusctions and data.

Now say we have Car Brand A an Car Brand B. They are both cars. Why? Because they share the same attributes in the Car class. If you got a new car, it will be a new Car object.

1. Next, we will handle Twitter authentication and the connection to the Twitter API. To do so, we will need to create the `auth` variable to authenticate using the credentials we have in the **twitter\_credentials.py** file. We will use the OAuthHandler from the Tweepy module to authenticate our "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret". To complete the authenication process, we will set the access token to the "Access Token" and "Access Token Secret" from that same file. 

```python
listener = StdOutListener()
auth = OAuthHandler(twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_KEY, twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_SECRET)
auth.set access_token (twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN, twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
```

1. Next, we will create a stream using the **Stream** class from the Tweepy module and pass in the auth and listener objects. 

```python
stream = Stream(auth, listener)
```

The **Stream** class from Tweepy is used to download twitter messages in real time. It is useful for obtaining a high volume of tweets, or for creating a live feed using a site stream or user stream. \([Tweepy Docs](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/streaming_how_to.html)\)

1. We will also filter tweets with specific keywords when streaming in the data. To do so, we will use "track" to track those keywords, which is provided through the hash\_tag\_list parameter. 

```python
stream.filter(track = hash_tag_list)
```

Here is what the Python code should look like in your **tweepy\_streamer.py** file under your **TwitterStreamer** class.

```python
class TwitterStreamer():
  def stream_tweets(self, fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)

  #Twitter Authentication
    listener = StdOutListener()
  auth = OAuthHandler(twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_KEY, twitter_credentials.CONSUMER_SECRET)
  auth.set access_token (twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN, twitter_credentials.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

  stream = Stream(auth, listener)          # create Stream class
     stream.filter(track = hash_tag_list) # filter keywords
```
