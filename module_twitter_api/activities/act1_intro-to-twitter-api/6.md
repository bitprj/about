# Connecting Our Classes in Main

Now that we have made the **TwitterStreamer** and the **StdOutListener** class, we will now incorporate them together to have working code.

**StdOutListener** class

1. In that main function, you will create a list called hash\_tag\_list of the specific keywords that you want to search within tweets. You can enter any keyword that you want in the quotation marks.

```python
hash_tag_list = [""]
```

A list in Python is a collection that is indexed, allows repeating items, and items are changeable. They're very similar to arrays

1. Next, you will create the text file to where all the tweet data will be stored. You can name that **tweets.txt** to the fetched\_tweets\_filename variable.

```python
fetched_tweets_filename = "tweets.txt"
```

This was just a txt file name in the format of a string which is stored in `fetched_tweets_filename`.

1. Furthermore, you will a Twitter streamer object using the **TwitterStreamer** class and the **stream\_tweets** function in that class. You will pass in the fetched\_tweets\_filename and hash\_tag\_list arguments that you just made.

```python
twitter_streamer = TweeterStreamer()
twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

Here what your main function should look like in your **tweepy\_streamer.py** file.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hash_tag_list = [""]
  fetched_tweets_filename = "tweets.txt"

  twitter_streamer = TweeterStreamer()
  twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

With that, when you run your **tweepy\_streamer.py** file on terminal, you will see the tweet data corresponding to your keywords in hash\_tag\_list appear in your **tweets.txt** file. You have officially finished streaming live tweets from Twitter onto a file on your computer.

Here is what your live tweet should look similar to if you run it in your terminal.
