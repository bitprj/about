Words like nouns, verbs, and adjectives make sentences make sense grammarly and structurally but they make NLTK more complicated becuase of the ambiguity of one word having more than one meaning.

Basically like label of what kind of word it is.

Let's cosider an exmaple sentence: "The dog ate the cat".

Here:

* 'the' will be labeled DT.
* 'dog' will be labeled NN.
* 'ate' will be labeled VBD.
* 'the' again labeled DT.
* 'cat' will be labeled NN.

You can see how these labels match the word using the chart.
