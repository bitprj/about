# Lancaster Stemmer

Now let's try another stemmer called the Lancaster Stemmer.

Like for the Porter Stemmer we just did, we want to import it and make an object of it.

```text
from nltk.stem import LancasterStemmer
lst = LancasterStemmer()
```

Now let's try to do the same and try printing out the origins of the list of "give" and see what Lancaster Stemmer does.

```text
for words in word_to_stem:
    print(words + ": " + les.stem(words))
```

Output:

* give: giv
* giving: giv
* given: giv
* gave: giv

This actaully outputs differently. From here, you can tell the Lancaster stemmer returns a more general output of a origin that might not be a word. On the other hand, Porter returns origins where each word, even though they all originated from give, had different outputted origins.
