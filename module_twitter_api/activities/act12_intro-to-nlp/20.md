Chinking \(in the context of NLP\) is picking up individual pieces of information anf grouping them into bigger pieces. It is the oppisite of tokenization.

Think of it like building a puzzle. You start out probably with putting to get to the edges and part of the the picture where you can find the most pieces of.

This helps with data mining and processing by understanding the language through picking up pieces of information and groups them into chunks. Chunks make it easier for us to process data.
