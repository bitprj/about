# Working with Lemmatization

First, let's import! from nltk.stem import wordnet from nktk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer wordLemma = WordNetLemmatizer

Then something simple to try it out: wordLemma.lemmatize\("corpora"\)

Output: 'corpus'

Yay! It gives the correct origin.

Now, let's also try it with the list of words so do:

```text
for words in word_to_stem:
    print(words + ": " + wordLemma.lemmatize(words))
```

The output will be give: give giving: giving given: given gave: gave

As we can see, lemmatization keeps the words how it is. This is happening because we haven't assigned any POS tagger \(part of speech tagger\). It determines which word is a noun, verb, etc. We will learn more about it in a few cards.
