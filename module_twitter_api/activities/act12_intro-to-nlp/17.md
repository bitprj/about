Let's bring POS into our code and see what happens.

First, import fucntions we will use: from nltk import pos\_tag, word\_tokenize

Then we're going to use a sentence on POS so type: sent = "Timothy is a natural when it comes to drawing" sentTokens = word\_tokenize\(sent\)

`word_ tokenize()` function means for the string to split off punctuation other than periods.

Next, add: for token in sentTockens: print\(nltk.pos\_tag\(\[token\]\)\)

Output should be

* \[\('Timothy', 'NN'\)\]
* \[\('is', 'VBZ'\)\]
* \[\('a', 'DT'\)\]
* \[\('natural', 'JJ'\)\]
* \[\('when', 'WRB'\)\]
* \[\('it', 'PRP'\)\]
* \[\('comes', 'VBZ'\)\]
* \[\('to', 'TO'\)\]
* \[\('drawing', 'VBG'\)\]

Next, we're going to stop with the coding but just understand some more of the concepts in NLTK that deals with words similar to POS.
