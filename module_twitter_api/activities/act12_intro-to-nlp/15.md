# Stop words

These words are key to making sentences valid but in natural language processing \(NLP\), it's not useful. NTLK actually has its own list of stop words so let's explore that in this card. \(visual of some of the stop words in English is below\)

First let's import them by doing so: from nltk.corpus import stopwords

Next let's make sure the computer knows that we're using english so add: stopwords.words\('english'\) This will print out the list of stop words from NLTK in English.

How many stop words are there? Type: len\(stopwords.words\('english'\)\) Since we got a list of words, we can use len\(\) to calculate the length of it. The output should be 179.
