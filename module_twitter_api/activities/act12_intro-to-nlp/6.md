# Different Uses and Purposes

The next couple cards we will be exploring NLTK and what tools we have available with it. NLTK is quite an extensive library so we will only be able to explore some tools.

We will choose the file name `brown`. Import this with:

```python
from nltk.corpus import brown
brown.words()
```

When we input the commands, you'll see a simple list of words. These are the words in the file brown. Another feature we'll explore is `fileids`.

If we look at the `gutenberg` file, we will see a bunch of texts. This can be done with

```python
nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids
```

Once inputed, we will see a bunch of texts such as Shakespear, the bible, etc.
