# Stemming

Stemming is the how NLTK normalizes words into its base form. For example,

* affects
* affected
* affecting
* affectation
* affection

All these words stem from the word affect.

This way may be good to use in some applications but it does not always work because it does have some limitations.

Let's see how it works!
