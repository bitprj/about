Before we can use sklearn library, we first need to install them onto our system or else our `import` statements will not be able to find the sklearn packages.

First, type `python --version` to see if you have Python 3 installed

If you receive some output like

```text
$ python --version
Python 3.6.8
```

Then Python 3 is associated with the `python` command, great!

Type the following to install the sklearn packages

```python
pip install sklearn
```

If this fails, try appending `sudo` in front

```text
sudo pip install sklearn
```

However, if you see something like

```text
$ python --version
Python 2.7.15
```

Then, try `python3 --version`

```text
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.8
```

This means that you should append a 3 onto your pip command, so type

```text
pip3 install sklearn
```

or

```text
sudo pip3 install sklearn
```
