With larger training datasets or longer grid searches, we may want to save our model so we do not have to recreate it from scratch.

We can use the `pickle` library

First, import `pickle` at the top.

```python
import pickle
```

To save our model `clf`, we first open a pickle file in both write and binary mode

```python
with open('./models/sentiment_classifier.pkl', 'wb') as f:
```

Then, we use pickle's `dump` function

```python
with open('./models/sentiment_classifier.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(clf, f)
```

If we want to load it, we use the `load` function in a similar fashion. Instead of write mode, we open the file in read mode

```python
with open('./models/sentiment_classifier.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_clf = pickle.load(f)
```

Now, `loaded_clf` holds our saved model, ready for use!
