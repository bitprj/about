# Bag Of Words

We first train our Bag of Words with some sample text

Let's say we have the following string

```python
s1 = "The apple is red"
```

We store this phrase into our corpus \(our known words\).

Now we want to transform other strings into vectors based on the first sentence.

Let's say we want a vectorized version of:

```python
s2 = "The orange is not red"
```

Our corpus knows the words "The", "apple", "is", and "red".

The words in `s2` that are also in our corpus \(currently only `s1`\) are "The", "is", and "red". These words have a value of 1 in the final vector, while the other two words "orange" and "not" have a value of 0 because they are not in our corpus \(`s1`\).

```text
Corpus: ["The", "apple", "is", "red"]
# s2 was "The orange is not red"
# after Bag of Words, it is [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

[    1          0          1         0         1        ]
    The        orange     is        not        red
```

"The" → inside corpus → 1

"orange" → not inside corpus → 0

"is" → inside corpus → 1

"not" → inside corpus → 0

"red" → not inside corpus → 1

So our final vector for "The orange is not red" is

```python
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
```
