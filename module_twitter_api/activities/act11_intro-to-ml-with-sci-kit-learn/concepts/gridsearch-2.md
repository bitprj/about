# Grid Search

In supervised learning, we make models, train them, then use them to predict values given an input.

However, which hyperparameters yields the model with the highest accuracy?

Instead of guessing each combination of hyperparameters \(which could take a long time\), we can use grid search in a programmatic way.

Grid Search goes through each combination of hyperparameters we provide it and returns the score or accuracy of the prediction.
