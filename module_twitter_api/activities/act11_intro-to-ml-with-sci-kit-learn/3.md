![Image result for word vectors](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSqC9hr0SP-s7eUINENRJBxzeIeAi_OY_zt7ooD2le9Y4SaMaJsNA&s)

If we instead decide we want to use a different word vectorizer, the modifications are minimal.

Instead of Count Vectorizer, let's use TFIDF Vectorizer.

They both are from the same library, so the import function is similar

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
```

All we have to do is replace our instance creation `count_vect = CountVectorizer()` with `count_vect = TfidfVectorizer()`

The rest of the code is the same

```python
count_vect = TfidfVectorizer() # create instance
train_text_vectors = count_vect.fit(train_text)

# transform data
train_vectors = count_vect.transform(train_text)
test_vectors = count_vect.transform(test_text)
```

The last thing we need to do is train a classifier with it, so we can predict the sentiment of reviews.
