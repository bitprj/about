Our reviews are currently strings, but in machine learning, it's difficult to work with strings. We need to transform them into a more workable form.

As with many other machine learning methods, we first split our data into a training group and testing group.

At the top, import the function `train_test_split` from sklearn, so we can use it.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

At the bottom of our existing code, split our variable `reviews` into a training and testing set using `train_test_split`

```python
# create 2 sets of data
training, test = train_test_split(reviews, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
```

Let's further divide each of the two sets by review and sentiment

```python
# create 2 sets of data
training, test = train_test_split(reviews, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# get training sets
train_text = [x.text for x in training]
train_sentiment = [x.sentiment for x in training]

# get testing sets
test_text = [x.text for x in test]
test_sentiment = [x.sentiment for x in test]
```

We can use a machine learning method called Bags Of Words to transform the reviews from strings into vectors.

Sklearn has this method already pre-written for us to use!

Go to the documentation page at the following link:

[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text\_analytics/working\_with\_text\_data.html\#extracting-features-from-text-files](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html#extracting-features-from-text-files)

Like any other page on the Sklearn documentation site, there is already an example code snippet for us for easy integration, but we will use a slightly different version.

We first import the method `CountVectorizer` at the top.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
```

At the bottom of our code we create an instance of a `CountVectorizer` by calling it's constructor

```python
count_vect = CountVectorizer() # create instance
```

Read the reviews of the training data \(strings stored in `train_text`\) into `count_vect`

```python
count_vect = CountVectorizer() # create instance
train_vectors = count_vect.fit(train_text)
```

Transform our strings into feature vectors, remember we have two data sets: `train_text` and `test_text`

```python
count_vect = CountVectorizer() # create instance
train_text_vectors = count_vect.fit(train_text)

# transform data
train_vectors = count_vect.transform(train_text)
test_vectors = count_vect.transform(test_text)
```

We now have our transformed data!
