# Creating a Listener Class

Following the previous activity, we will create a class called **StdOutListener**, representing Standard Output Listener, and it will be a basic listener class that prints received tweets to a file. You will first create a constructor **init** to fetch the filename that the data will be sent to.

The StreamListener class also provides us with methods that we can override. With that, we will be using on\_data and on\_error methods.

* The on\_data method will take in the data that is streamed in from the StreamListener, which is reading in tweets, and allows us to work with that data. In this part:

  * Use a try and except statement to catch errors when trying to stream in the data.
  * When the stream is successful, you will write the data to the text file that you created in the init constructor. 
  * If the stream holds errors, an exception statement will be printed out.

  ```python
  def on_data(self, data):
    try:
     print(data)
     with open(self.fetched_tweets_filename, 'a') as tf:
       tf.write(data)
       return True
     except BaseException as e:
      print("Error on_data: %s" % str(e))
      return True
  ```

* The on\_error method will give us the error that is occurring.

  * Print that output onto the screen.

  ```python
  def on_error(self, data):
    print(data)
  ```

Here is what your Python code should look like when constructing the definitions with the **StdOutListener** class in your **tweepy\_streamer.py** file.

```python
class StdOutListener(StreamListener):
  def __init__(self, fetched_tweets_filename):                             #create constructor
    self.fetched_tweets_filename = fetched_tweets_filename

  def on_data(self, data):                                                                    #take in streamed data
    try:                                                                                                        #try when there's no error
      print(data)
      with open(self.fetched_tweets_filename, 'a') as tf:
        tf.write(data)
      return True
    except BaseException as e:                                                             #when there's an error
      print("Error on_data: %s" % str(e))
        return True

    def on_error(self, data):                                                                 #print the error occurring
    print(data)
```
