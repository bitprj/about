# Connecting Our Classes in Main

Now that we have made the **TwitterStreamer** and the **StdOutListener** class, we will now incorporate them together to have working code.

1. In that main function, you will create a hash\_tag\_list of the specific keywords that you want to search within tweets. You can enter any keyword that you want in the quotation marks.

```python
hash_tag_list = [""]
```

1. Next, you will create the text file to where all the tweet data will be stored. You can name that **tweets.txt** to the fetched\_tweets\_filename variable.

```python
fetched_tweets_filename = "tweets.txt"
```

1. Furthermore, you will a Twitter streamer object using the **TwitterStreamer** class and the **stream\_tweets** function in that class. You will pass in the fetched\_tweets\_filename and hash\_tag\_list arguments that you just made.

```python
twitter_streamer = TweeterStreamer()
twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

Here what your main function should look like in your **tweepy\_streamer.py** file.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hash_tag_list = [""]
  fetched_tweets_filename = "tweets.txt"

  twitter_streamer = TweeterStreamer()
  twitter_streamer.stream_tweets(fetched_tweets_filename, hash_tag_list)
```

With that, when you run your **tweepy\_streamer.py** file on terminal, you will see the tweet data corresponding to your keywords in hash\_tag\_list appear in your **tweets.txt** file. You have officially finished streaming live tweets from Twitter onto a file on your computer.

Here is what your live tweet should look similar to if you run it in your terminal.
