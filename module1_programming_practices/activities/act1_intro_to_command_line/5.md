You can create new files in your directories by using the `touch` command. To create a new file called _words.txt_ in your present working directory, type `touch words.txt`. To create a new file at a specific location, use the relative path. You are already in the directory ~/new\_dire, and dire is a subdirectory of new\_dire. Simply type `touch dire/test.log` to make a file named _test.log_ under your sub-directory _new\_dire/dire_.
