In order to use the command line on your computer, you need to setup the command line tools. Below are the instructions of installing command line tools in different operating systems.

## Mac User

**Open the terminal**

* You can open Finder and search for Terminal.
* It should be located in /Application/Utilities.

**Type `xcode-select --install`**

* A popup should open asking you to install command line tools.
* Say yes.
* If you get a "not currently available error", it means that you already have it.
* Type `gcc -v` in the terminal and you should see a whole bunch of configuration values show up on the screen if things are working.

## Windows Users

**Cygwin** is an open source collection of tools that allows Unix or Linux applications to be compiled and run on a Windows operating system from within a Linux-like interface. Using Cygwin, developers can more easily provide remote support for applications running on Windows platforms.

**Download Cygwin**

* Go to [https://cygwin.com/install.html](https://cygwin.com/install.html) and select [setup-x86\_64.exe](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe).
* Place setup-x86.exe in a location where you will be able to find again.

**Install Cygwin**

* Run the setup file you downloaded and click next.
* Select _Install From Internet_ and click next.
* Choose a location \(recommend for non-default location so you can find it again\) to install Cygwin.
* Select _All Users_ and click next.
* For the _Local Package Directory_ select the same directory you put the installer in and click next.
