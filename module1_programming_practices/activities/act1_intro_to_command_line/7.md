If you want to copy the content of a file to either a new one or overwriting an existing file, you can use the `cp` command to achieve this, by putting at least two filenames in its arguments.

Make sure you are in the directory ~/new\_dire using `cd`. Then type `cp words.txt copy.txt` to make a new file called _copy.txt_ that has the exact same content with _words.txt_. Then, type `ls` to check your work. Your output should consist of two file names: _words.txt_ and _copy.txt_.

You can also copy directories by giving two directory names as the arguments. Then `cp` will copy all files of a source directory to the destination directory. Copying directories requires an additional option, typically **-r**, to indicate the recursive copying of directories. We'll explain command line options in the next activity.
