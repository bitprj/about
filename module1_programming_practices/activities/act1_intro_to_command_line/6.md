# 6

Type `ls` to view the file and sub-directory in your current working directory. You should see _words.txt_ and _dire_. The `ls` command will list the contents of the present working directory.

To view the contents of any other directory, you can either specify its name \(if it’s a subdirectory\) or its complete path \(if it’s not a subdirectory\) as an argument to the `ls` command.

Type `cd ~` to go back to your home directory, and type `ls new_dire/dire` to view your content in the sub-directory _dire_. The output should just be _test.log_, which is the file you have created.
