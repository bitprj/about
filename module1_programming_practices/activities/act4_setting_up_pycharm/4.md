Before you can share the results of your work by **pushing your changes to the upstream**, or merging the changes from your current branch to its remote branch, you need to synchronize with the remote repository to make sure your local copy of the project is up to date. You can do this in one of the following ways: **fetch changes** or **pull changes**.

On PyCharm, open a new project in a new folder, and then choose **VCS \| Checkout from Version Control \| Git**. Enter the URL of your GitHub repo _new\_repo_ which you have created by completing the GitHub activity, or any repository you have, and specify the directory of your new project.

## Fetch Changes

When you **fetch** changes from the upstream, all new data from commits that were made since you last synced with the remote repository is downloaded into your local copy. This new data is not integrated into your local files, and changes are not applied to your code.

Before fetching changes, let's make a change in your GitHub repo. In your GitHub account, go to the repository named _new\_repo_, or any other repository you just checkout to.

Click **Create new file** to make a file name _test.py_ and type `print("This is a new change from remote repo")`. At the bottom of the page, click the green button **Commit new file**.

## Pull Changes

**Pulling** changes from a remote repository is a convenient shortcut for fetching and subsequently merging changes. When you **pull**, you not only download new data, but also integrate it into your local working copy of the project.

From the main menu, choose **VCS \| Git \| Pull**. The **Pull Changes** dialog opens. Double check that all the information is correct, then you can click **Pull** to update your local repository.

You will also notice that the new file _test.py_ is added to your local project.

Since fetch does not affect your local development environment, this is a safe way to get an update of all changes to a remote repository.
