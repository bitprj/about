Open the PyCharm program. If you don't have an account yet, register a JetBrains account [here](https://account.jetbrains.com/login). After finishing account registration, come back to PyCharm to login.

Once you login successfully, click `Create New Project` with `Pure Python`, and store the program in a location where you will remember, and name the folder _HelloWorld_. Click `Create`.

You will see a page as shown below. Notice that the navigation bar on the bottom has `Python Console` and `Terminal`. You can directly use a **Python interpreter** in the section `Python Console`, and you can access Unix-like command lines to **modify your filesystem** or to **collaborate with your GitHub repository** in `Terminal`.

Click the `Python Console` and enter `print("Hello World")`. You will see the program display the statement "Hello World" on the screen. In this section, you can experiment with Python statements before adding them to your main code.

Now, click the `Terminal` and you will see that your present working directory is the directory where you created this PyCharm file. Enter the `pwd` command to verify your current working directory. In the terminal, you can access useful command line commands that we have learned previously to modify your filesystem or communicate with a GitHub repository.
