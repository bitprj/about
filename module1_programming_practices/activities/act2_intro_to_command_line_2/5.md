Go to your sub-directory _cpdire_ by typing `cd cpdire`, then type `echo "Hello World" > copy.txt` to direct the output "Hello World" to your text file _copy.txt_ . This is call _command line redirection_ .

If you use the `echo` to redirect output to _copy.txt_ again, the command will overwrite the original content. However, you can use `>>` to append the output of the command to a file.

Type `echo "This is an appended line" >> copy.txt` to append the statement "This is an appended line" to the content of _copy.txt_.

If you have the input for a program that reads from standard input stored in a file and don't want to type it, you can feed that file's inputs into the program using `<`.

For example: `some_program < inputFileName`.
