The behavior of shell commands can be modified by **command line options**. These entries can pass along cues for changing various settings or executing variants of commands.

They are commonly represented by a single letter followed by a `-`. For example, `-l`, `-a`, `-d` could all be options that follow a shell command.

Back to the discussion about copying directories above, type `cp -r dire copydire` \(`-r` can either be lowercase or uppercase\) to create a new directory _copydire_ and recursively copy all the files from _dire_. Now, type `ls copydire dire` to check the content of both directories, and you should see that both of them contain the file _test.log_.

Notice that if the directory _copydire_ **already exists** before executing the `cp` command, then the copy of _dire_ becomes a **sub-directory** under _copydire_.

Since you have created the directory _cpdire_, type `cp -r dire cpdire` again, and then `ls cpdire`. Notice that _cpdire_ has a file _test.log_ and a sub-directory _dire_.

Here is a more specific explanation for copying a directory to an existing directory and to a non-existing directory:

```text
$ cp - r dire copydire //Copying dire to a non-existing copydire.
$ ls copydire
test.log // Copied the file from dire to copydire.

$ cp -r dire cpdire // Copying dire to an existing cpdire.
$ ls cpdire
test.log  dire // Copied dire as a sub-directory under cpdire.
```
