You can use the `mv` command to move files or directories, either a single one or multiple ones, from one place to another.

Make sure you are in the directory ~/new\_dire. Type `mv copy.txt copydire` to move the file _copy.txt_ from the directory _new\_dire_ to _copydire_. Check the content of _new\_dire_ and _copydire_ by typing `ls` and `ls copydire` separately. You should notice that the file _copy.txt_ is moved from _new\_dire_ to _copydire_.

You can also do the same thing between directories by simply giving two directory names as arguments. Type `mv dire cpdire` to make _dire_ a sub-directory of _copydire_.

The syntax for `mv` is:

`mv [Option] source destination`

If the _destination_ **doesn't exist**, it will rename the _source_ to be the _destination_. Type `mv words.txt rename.txt` to rename the file _words.txt_ to _rename.txt_. Check your work by typing `ls`. **Note that this is how you rename files in command line.**  There is no renaming command, we simply use `mv`.

If the _destination_ **exists**, it will be overwritten and the source file will be deleted. Type `mv cpdire/test.log replace.txt`. You will see that the _test.log_ is deleted, and the directory _new\_dire_ has a new file called _replace.txt_. Note, _replace.txt_ appears in the directory because you have executed the command in your present working directory, which is _new\_dire_.

By default, `mv` doesn't prompt for overwriting the existing file, so be careful.
