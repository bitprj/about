# Push a Branch to GitHub

Now, let's **push** the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo, so other people can see the changes you've made.

To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, run `git push origin new_branch`. GitHub will create the branch for you on the remote repository.

You would see a message similar to this \(the data might be slightly different\):

```text
$ git push origin new_branch

\(In case you wonder what _origin_ word means in the command above.\)

If you refresh your GitHub page, you'll see a note saying that a branch with your name has just been pushed into the repository. You can also click the `branches` link to see your branch listed there.

You're going to click the green button `Compare & pull request` because we're going to make a pull request in our next topic.
