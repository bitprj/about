## Get Changes Back to Computer

Even though the repo on GitHub has the latest version of code, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the master branch doesn't exist in the master branch on your local machine.

First, move your present working branch to the master by running `git checkout master`.

![&#x5C4F;&#x5E55;&#x5FEB;&#x7167; 2020-01-20 &#x4E0B;&#x5348;10.28.05](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1gb4al1dg8qj314003ut9g.jpg)Then, You can use the `git pull origin master` command \(when working on the master branch\) to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub. You will see the information of all the files that have changed and how they've changed.

![&#x5C4F;&#x5E55;&#x5FEB;&#x7167; 2020-01-20 &#x4E0B;&#x5348;10.28.11](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1gb4alu1l6ij31620fygp2.jpg)Now, you can use the `git log` command again to see all new commits.
