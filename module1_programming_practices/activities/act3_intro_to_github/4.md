# Create a Git Branch

Here is a situation that you're likely to encounter in your future programming: you want to add a new feature for your program, but you don't want to make changes to your main project while developing the feature, just yet.

This is when **git branches** become useful in git. You can develop a specific part of your project in your branches without affecting the main part of your project.

Enter `git checkout -b new_branch` to create a new branch to develop your project. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check it out', meaning git will move you to that branch \(notice that "master" becomes "new\_branch"\), off of the master branch.

After running the above command, type `git branch` to confirm your work and view the branches under your master branch. In this case. it looks like:

```text
$ git branch
master
* new_branch
```

Inside the new branch, make a new file called _new\_file.txt_ by running `touch new_file.txt`.

Recall from the previous activity that git will notice that changes have been made inside the repo. However, git won't officially keep track of the file unless you commit the change to git. Run the `git status` to see which files git is aware of.

Enter `git add new_file.txt` to add it to the staging environment.

Run `git commit -m "Ready for pull request."` to commit the change.

use`git log` to see all the commits you made
