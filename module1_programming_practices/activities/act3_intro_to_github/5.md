# Create New Repository on GitHub

If you work as an individual to keep track of your code locally, you don't need to use GitHub. However, if you want to work with a team, you can use GitHub to collaboratively modify the project's code.

Log in and go to the GitHub home page, and you should see a green `+ New repository` button or the green `New` on the left side next to `Repositories`:

**Git local repository** is the one on which we will make **local** changes, typically this **local repository** is on our computer.

**Git remote repository** is the one of the server. It's a shared repository by the team. All team members can make commits to the repository.
