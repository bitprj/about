# Add a New File to the Repo

Since you have a git repository now, you can add new files to the repo by using any text editor or running a `touch` command.

Type `touch test.txt` to add a file named _test.txt_ in the folder _gitfolder_ containing a git repo. Git will notice that changes have been made inside the repo. However, git won't officially keep track of the file unless you commit the change to git.

Use the `git status` command to see which files git is aware of. You will expect to see the following message:

![&#x5C4F;&#x5E55;&#x5FEB;&#x7167; 2020-01-20 &#x4E0B;&#x5348;10.03.53](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwgy1gb4a4wp7cvj31f20dg0uu.jpg)

This message basically means that git has noticed that you created a new file called _test.txt_. Unless you use the `git add` command, git will not do anything about it.
