Now, use `Ctrl + Shift + V` to paste the command and URL onto your git bash. And go back to the GitHub page to copy the second command and paste it onto your git bash.

If you experience problem on your first command that says `fatal: remote origin already exists.`, then run this command `git remote set-url origin *your URL on GitHub*`.

Run `git push -u origin master`.

You should see the message similar to this:

```text
mnelson:myproject mnelson$ git remote add origin https://github.com/cubeton/mynewrepository.git 

mnelson:myproject mnelson$ git push -u origin master

Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
```

\(Your URL in the first command line is different depending on your GitHub username and repo name are different.\)
