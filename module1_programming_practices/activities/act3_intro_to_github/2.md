# Create a new repository

To create a new project on your local machine using git, you need to create a new repository. We will use the terminal and basic commands for this activity. You should have some experience with basic command lines from the previous activity. If not, refer to the activity _Intro to Command Line_ for the usage of command line.

To begin, open up a terminal \(the git bash\), and move your directory to where you want to place the project on your local machine, using the `cd` command. For convenience in this activity, let's start from your home directory and make a sub-directory called _gitfolder_.

Type `mkdir gitfolder` to create a sub-directory and type `cd gitfolder` to move your present working directory to there.

To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the `git init` command. You will see that the bash changes the appearance of your current working directory to be `(master)`.

This means that your current directory \(folder\) is initialized as a git repository.
