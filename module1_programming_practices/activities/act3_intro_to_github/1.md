## Installing Git

**Installing on macOS**

The easiest way to install Git on a Mac is to install the XCode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks \(10.9\) or above you can do this simply by trying to run `git` from the Terminal the very first time.

`$ git --version`

"Command Line Tools" can be downloaded separate from Xcode at [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/)

Xcode can be downloaded from the app store.

If you would like a more up-to-date version, you can download a Git installer [here](https://git-scm.com/).

**After Installing**

Once you have done installing Git, create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join). \(Accounts are free for public repositories, but may be different for private repositories\).

Once you sign up, you can now sign in GitHub.

### **Configure git to work with GitHub**

Open Terminal and type the following command line.

`git config --global user.name "Your username of GitHub"`

`git config --global user.email "Your email"`
